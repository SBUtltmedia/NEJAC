As EPA addresses the questions needed to incorporate environmental justice into permitting, it would be important to learn from positive examples. NEJAC on many occasions, for example, has cited the effectiveness of EPA's Community Action for a Renewed Environment (CARE) program. That program may well have examples where environmental justice was successfully incorporated into facility permits to the benefit of the affected community. </p><ul><li>Tribal perspective: The Council heard that EPA has improved its advance notification to tribes of permit activity. This is welcomed, and we encourage the Agency to do even more (and earlier) coordination of this nature. </li><li>State perspective: From a state perspective, we have learned that incorporating environmental justice early in the permitting process reduces the time it takes to review and issue a permit. The public should be made aware of prospective permit applications prior to the state's reaching the technical sufficiency stage of permit review, and before the legal notice of application is published. Permit conditions that satisfy all parties should be incorporated before the formal public comment period is announced. Early, meaningful public involvement prior to reaching tentative determination eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming formal adjudicatory hearings. For example, the State of Connecticut requires that applicants in environmental justice communities draft a public outreach plan detailing efforts to be taken. Those efforts include a mandatory informational public meeting coordinated with approval and oversight by the Environmental Justice Program office. The public participation plan required is in the form of a template that is provided to applicants to guide them through the process and provide the state with relevant information for evaluation.

In these roles, the staff serve as a liaison among various federal agencies and programs to enhance the efficient access to federal resources. Often, these placements help to give voice to community concerns about adverse environmental impacts by providing technical expertise and a dedicated resource. This practice has yielded great benefits to communities, such as East Palo Alto, California. This practice should be expanded to service more communities nationwide. </p><p>However, certain considerations should be taken into account before this program is expanded. First of all, these individuals should want to be in such a position; it is not a job to simply be assigned. These individuals need to possess outstanding interests and skills with public relations, cultural awareness, understanding federal grant processes, environmental assessment, and cleanup requirements and processes. They also need to have a true interest and skill for working with relatively diverse stakeholders. Such experts must be willing to act in the position for an extended period of time (possibly years) if it is to be successful.</p><p>Specific to this recommendation, EPA should plan early to ensure that funding for this resource is available and utilized throughout a brownfields redevelopment and revitalization effort. Early budget requests and allocation is paramount to implement this recommendation. Placement of such staff should happen as soon as a brownfields site has been selected. Likewise, community stakeholders should be looking for this resource early and remind EPA of the need and value that comes from such individuals. Additionally, EPA should hire or support the hiring of local expertise to be available directly to community groups (as opposed to local government entities). Such expertise may include toxicologists, environmental consultants, community outreach/facilitation firms, and environmental scientists who can be technical advocates for the residents and local businesses in the area. Early and on-going funding for these local government/community tools is critical for long-term success and more equitable community involvement.</p><p>EPA's use of IPAs has been very successful.

They cross all media ' land, air, and water. Independently, media-specific impacts have been the focus of EPA's work for years. However, if the combined, accumulating impacts of industrial, commercial, and municipal development continue to be ignored, the synergistic problems will only get worse. The cleanup of past industrial practices must be thorough and safe for all vulnerable populations. </p><p>By far, the populations most impacted by brownfields decisions are those who live, work, play, or worship near a contaminated site. These people are already in areas of high pollutant loading, with generally higher rates of asthma (e.g. Albina). Vulnerable populations like pregnant women, the elderly, children, and those individuals with preexisting health problems are at increased risk. In many environmental justice communities, a brownfield site may be the only park-like setting available, so it can attract some of the most vulnerable populations.</p><p>To the extent members of the community are forced to leave because of increased housing costs, the community loses a piece of its fabric, and sometimes knowledge of history and culture. This adverse impact needs to be addressed as part of a cumulative assessment. The sense of identity common to many environmental justice communities is threatened when communities are displaced. </p><p>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), through its environmental impact statement (EIS), is the primary and current federal statutory authority/process for considering cumulative effects. However, EISs are often inadequate to address environmental justice, gentrification and dislocation issues. In the main, EISs have not considered the more social or selective impacts associated with these issues. When determining the scope of issues to be addressed during the preparation of an EIS, an agency must consider direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts (40 CFR '1508.25). EPA and its delegated state agencies (not to mention other federal agencies that also are subject to NEPA) must pay closer attention to the explicit inclusion of these environmental justice issues. In 1997, the Council on Environmental Quality directed federal agencies to consider environmental justice issues in the EIS process. Agencies must consider relevant public health data and industry data concerning the potential for multiple exposures or cumulative exposure to human health.</p><p>Methods for analyzing cumulative effects include:</p><ol><li>carrying capacity analysis,</li><li>ecosystem analysis, and </li><li>social impact analysis</li></ol>. The carrying capacity analysis method identifies thresholds (as constraints on development) and provides mechanisms to monitor the incremental use of unused capacity. Carrying capacity in the ecological context is defined as the threshold of stress below which populations and ecosystem functions can be sustained. In the social context, the carrying capacity of a region is measured by the level of services (including ecological services) required by the community. The strengths of this method are that it is a true measure of cumulative effects against a threshold, it addresses the effects in a system context, and it addresses time factors. Its weaknesses are that it is currently difficult to measure this kind of capacity directly, there may be multiple thresholds, and this type of regional information in the United States often is not developed.<p></p><p>Ecosystem analysis explicitly addresses biodiversity and sustainability issues. It uses natural boundaries (e.g., watersheds) and applies ecological indicators. Ecosystem analysis entails a broad regional perspective. Its strengths are that it uses regional scale and addresses a large range of ecological interactions (including synergy, antagonism, and catalysis), addresses time, and seeks sustainability. Its current weaknesses are that it is limited to natural systems, requires more data than currently available, and some of the landscape indicators are still under development. </p><p>Social impact analysis addresses cumulative effects related to sustainability of human communities by focusing on variables such as demographics, community and institutional structures, political, social, and economic resources. It projects future effects using social analysis techniques such as linear trend projections. Its strengths are that it addresses social issues, and that the models provide definitive, qualified results. Its weaknesses are that utility and accuracy of results are dependent on data quality and model assumptions, and that social values are highly variable over time. </p><p>An engaged community with capacity could select a combination of the above factors that would tailor a community assessment to their place and their people. These methods can capture unintended consequences and impacts of urban environmental policy interventions, such as population displacement. Local populations, public health practitioners, and government officials should be well informed about 'the whole picture,' not just the one redevelopment site under consideration.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77941' target='_blank'>Unintended Impacts of Redevelopment and Revitalization Efforts in Five Environmental Justice Communities</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>13 and 14</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>The report contains advice and recommendations on the unintended adverse impacts of the EPA's cleanup, redevelopment and revitalization efforts.

The process also should examine which local businesses may be displaced through the redevelopment effort.</p><p>The assessment should be done by the developers and reviewed by local residents and stakeholders. EPA could help by providing assistance and U.S. Census data expertise. The process should be fully open to the community/neighborhoods. This could include a series of public meetings to ensure ample opportunities to learn about, observe, and participate in such a process. This process would build trust and assist all parties with understanding the Census data. Such an assessment also should track data not available from the Census, such as the homeless, new residents, seasonal migrant residents, and other undercounted subpopulations. The under- or non-counted residents may be those most likely to be displaced.</p><p>Likewise, smaller local businesses are more likely to be undercounted and thus under represented in assessing and protecting their displacement. These business owners are more likely to be unable to attend planning meetings, grant assistance workshops, proposal hearings, etc. These workers and business owners include restaurants, home daycare providers, repair shops, and convenience stores. These businesses are least likely to afford newer, more expensive commercial redevelopment properties. These businesses should be identified and counted early on in the process by the local residents and clients who are familiar with them. This kind of assessment can help prevent, and at least better record, gentrification on the commercial side.</p><p>EPA should develop a process and/or guidelines to support these demographic assessments for all of its redevelopment efforts. The process should start with the review of the most recent Census data. The assessment should enhance, with the help of stakeholders, the Census data regarding the undercounted. Stakeholders will know which 'businesses' will be mostly impacted. The assessment may require door-to-door surveys, which could be carried out by the stakeholders and residents.

In this regard, EPA has a dilemma. The Agency rightly seeks to hear new voices in the discussion of environmental justice issues, but it also needs to have the steady advice of those schooled in these issues. The environmental, health and civil rights contexts for environmental justice challenges are complex. As it is with any advisory body in a complex area, some of the NEJAC's advice has been good, and some has not been easy to implement for practical reasons. EPA needs to have the benefit of the institutional memory of NEJAC members who have experienced the context in which advice has been given and implemented, as well as advice that has not worked. EPA will benefit by hearing from those who have seen both good and bad practices. The NEJAC therefore urges EPA, when appointing members to the next NEJAC, to assure that new participants for each stakeholder group are accompanied and mentored by experienced council members who have a history of participating in environmental justice forums, having heard and understood diverse perspectives, and reflecting the collaborative, problem-solving mentality that characterizes healthy and productive debate. This means that future councils should include those who have served on prior NEJACs or their equivalent, as well as new individuals who evidence commitment to and knowledge of environmental justice. In addition, EPA should utilize a process of staggered membership selection to ensure the participation of persons with appropriate experience and expertise.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77947' target='_blank'>Future Mechanisms to Enhance Stakeholder Involvement and Engagement to Address Environmental Justice</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>The National Environmental Justice Advisory Council's (NEJAC) report on mechanisms to enhance future stakeholder involvement and <br>engagement to achieve environmental justice for all communities.</td></tr></tbody>",

These mechanisms could include: formal notice and comment; regulatory negotiations; citizen juries with access to experts; public meetings, listening sessions, focus groups for timely advice/focus groups to discuss certain issues; and roundtable dialogues. On the whole, the NEJAC believes that mechanisms that are interactive and involve multistakeholders tend to have more value. Multi-stakeholder dialogue can lead to better decisions and greater public trust and support. Receiving input from varied perspectives insures that the EPA decision-maker will recognize the values of each stakeholder group and the benefits and burdens that possible alternative decisions may confer. Interactive dialogue among multiple stakeholders and government officials, particularly if it is deliberative, is likely to be more fruitful than separate input. Interaction may identify creative or overlooked decision-making options and alternatives acceptable to all participants that would not be apparent in the absence of communication among them. Involving multiple groups interactively also enhances the perception that the Agency's ultimate decision was reached in a transparent and fair manner, thereby raising public support for the decision and reducing the likelihood of challenges. In general, multi-stakeholder involvement and advice may be richer. However, targeted stakeholder involvement and advice, especially that of adversely impacted community representatives, can be invaluable to fully understand environmental problems, weaknesses, and failures of environmental policy and possible solutions. These mechanisms can be utilized, when appropriate, to complement existing federal advisory committee processes.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77947' target='_blank'>Future Mechanisms to Enhance Stakeholder Involvement and Engagement to Address Environmental Justice</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>The National Environmental Justice Advisory Council's (NEJAC) report on mechanisms to enhance future stakeholder involvement and <br>engagement to achieve environmental justice for all communities.</td></tr></tbody>",

Such a formal, written response is quite common in EPA rulemakings; a Response to Comment document is the rule rather than the exception. Since NEJAC reports represent the consensus views of a broad spectrum of stakeholders after extensive fact gathering and discussion, it is particularly appropriate that EPA respond to its federal advisory committee in a formal and informative way. Because NEJAC membership is likely to transition from the time of a report's creation to EPA's response, EPA should communicate in writing in order to assure that all who participated in the process have access to the Agency's determinations.

Because of the nature of environmental justice questions, the NEJAC cautions that such efforts to obtain expedited advice and recommendations should always include representatives of communitybased environmental justice organizations and organizations in disproportionately burdened communities. Advice from those directly impacted by environmental injustices must be highly valued as they alone have a full appreciation, based upon experience, of reduced quality of life from environmental hazards, and challenges from private and public sectors to address adverse impacts. To plan for such communications, EPA Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ) should maintain an up-to-date list of persons who can serve in this capacity. Additionally, EPA should be sensitive to the lack of capacity on the part of the environmental justice community and provide technical assistance, where necessary, to enhance the capacity of the impacted environmental justice community.

In consultation with affected stakeholders and utilizing available assessment tools, areas in greatest need can be identified for these targeted efforts. These areas can be communities or groups of communities with common environmental challenges.</p><p>Targeted geographic initiatives offer benefits to government, businesses, and communities by providing a greater role in contributing to the betterment of neighborhoods through an integrated and proactive approach to remediate, rebuild and sustain communities. Such a strategy emphasizes quality of life, economic development, and environmental protection improvements, which can only be accomplished through proactive collaboration.

The NEJAC is mindful that constraints on EPA's budget will always counsel the Agency to look for non-monetary ways to build partnerships and work collaboratively. Fortunately, responsible business and industry responds to and is educated by forms of recognition that are nearly cost-free for EPA. EPA already has seen the power of programs like Performance Track and Energy Star to incentivize business to go beyond compliance and strive for environmental and energy excellence. EPA should develop comparable opportunities in the environmental justice arena by providing public recognition and good will to companies participating in partnerships that advance community health and environment.</p><p>It is important to appreciate the kinds of practices envisioned here, and the purpose of employing business-oriented environmental justice activities to assist communities. Clearly, EPA and communities expect and demand full compliance with applicable environmental standards. In most communities with environmental justice issues, however, full compliance will not suffice to address the burdens the community faces. The businesses and industries located in those communities should be urged to exercise good citizenship and leadership by going beyond compliance to hear, understand and respond to concerns raised by communities with actions that address those concerns and improve quality of life. A collaborative approach can facilitate development of practices beneficial to communities and businesses, but far too little is known about the optimum process for achieving these win/win results or the substantive accomplishments of prior collaborations. Much of business and industry takes seriously its responsibility to be a good neighbor, but many lack concrete information about how to fulfill that role in a manner that meets the community's needs. EPA can fill that informational void by recognizing good practices that benefit communities with environmental justice issues and disseminating information on how they came about. As we have seen in Performance Track, this education on good practices is more powerful when those employing the practices are publicly recognized for their efforts.</p><p>The reports of the NEJAC provide an excellent basis for designing recognition programs. The Pollution Prevention report devotes a chapter to ways in which business and industry can reduce emissions and lessen environmental and health impacts on communities. Employing methods such as clean production, recycling and reuse, and waste minimization can reduce community risks and also make good business sense. The Cumulative Risk report outlines community-based approaches whereby business and industry in an area can work collaboratively with government and community members to identify, prioritize, and find creative mechanisms to reduce cumulative burdens. The locations that collectively go beyond compliance and improve environment and health surely are worthy of praise on EPA's website. In addition, EPA should include, in its current recognition programs, a subset of the activities focusing on improvement of environment and quality of life in communities with environmental justice issues. There could be special recognition within Energy Star or brownfields development projects of those sites where a community with environmental justice issues was benefited. Moreover, as discussed later in Recommendation #3.7, EPA could annually recognize sites and activities throughout its programs where business and industry advanced environmental justice by improving environmental protection and community quality of life.</p><p>EPA can also use its regulatory discretion to facilitate implementation of solutions reached through collaborative community and business efforts that go beyond compliance. For example, in some situations facility-wide permits may provide flexibility that makes it easier for business to implement the specific technologies and methods that communities request to reduce risk. Likewise, prompt government action to issue or modify permits as required to achieve collaborative goals would assist both communities and business. When working with communities, it is important that these host communities have sufficient independent technical resources to make independent decision. When a company working together with such a host community is prepared to go beyond compliance to achieve mutual goals, EPA should devote the necessary resources to promptly remove whatever regulatory impediments exist.</p><p>EPA should encourage business to voluntarily utilize existing systems and programs (e.g., pollution prevention, Responsible Care, 'Good Neighbor' agreements, environmental management systems, Supplemental Environmental Projects, community relations programs, sustainability initiatives) to promote environmental justice goals.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77947' target='_blank'>Future Mechanisms to Enhance Stakeholder Involvement and Engagement to Address Environmental Justice</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>9 - 11</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>The National Environmental Justice Advisory Council's (NEJAC) report on mechanisms to enhance future stakeholder involvement and <br>engagement to achieve environmental justice for all communities.</td></tr></tbody>",

It is critical that EPA take proactive steps in working with these governments as well as communities that are affected or seeking federal assistance. The growing complexity and number of environmental justice issues also require the Agency to work with these entities as well as other stakeholders to prioritize a set of actions or identify the communities that will be focused upon within a given time frame.</p><p>Once these tasks are identified, it is necessary to allocate adequate resources (fiscal, personnel and time needed) to mitigate the problems. Initiated actions sometimes are not completed because allocated resources cannot be sustained, thus leading to lack of trust and credibility. Hence, it may be necessary to allow Regional Offices to have the flexibility in prioritizing the tasks and allocation of resources. However, the criteria for the selection and prioritization could still be decided by OEJ in consultation with the NEJAC. Because the Agency's funding is usually limited, EPA should also collaborate with local stakeholders including state and local governments, NGOs, and industries to leverage and maximize other funding opportunities for mitigation projects.</p><p>In addition, it has been observed that most of the public do not have: a) an understanding of jurisdictional authorities of the federal, state, local and tribal governments and often view them as being hierarchical with the ability of overriding a decision; b) the interest or the time to attend multiple public forums to voice their concerns or provide comments on policy matters that are being debated at local, state, or federal levels, but may have community level impacts; and c) the confidence or trust that governmental structures and functions are committed to solving environmental justice-related problems faced by communities. Therefore, it will be mutually beneficial to have common public forums with the participation of all three levels of governments as well as elected officials.</p><p>These forums can fulfill the need for national forums, currently being accomplished through the NEJAC. In addition, they can identify cooperative and collaborative actions, to be implemented at the appropriate level of the government(s), to address citizen's concerns or resolve problems faced by communities.

This can be done at a programmatic level (e.g., developing models for community-based research), or at a site-specific policy, empirical, or technical level (studying cumulative impacts of a particular area).</li></ul><p>EPA can utilize academia more directly and more effectively in the future than the Agency has done in the past. Academics from a variety of disciplines have played an important role in promoting environmental law reforms for the purpose of promoting environmental justice. Sociologists, political scientists, and economists were primarily responsible for developing methodologies for examination of disparities in environmental protection and providing useful empirical studies that examined and largely supported many of the central claims of the environmental justice movement. Legal academics have examined laws, regulations and guidance documents, both to analyze the scope of legal authority to address environmental justice concerns, and to examine how regulatory programs and processes might tend to systematically generate racial and income inequities. These reviews of existing laws have included the environmental protection laws themselves, as well as the role of constitutional and civil rights law in environmental decision-making. Finally, environmental science and public health academics have contributed to a better understanding of the complex ecological and social dynamics that dramatically affect health and human services.</p><p>All of these areas of academic research have significantly enhanced the understanding of government regulators, regulated industry, and even the environmental justice communities themselves of the scope and causes of environmental injustices as well as the potential for competing legal and policy reforms for their redress. To that end, academics have often provided basic research, training, technical and policy analysis to communities with environmental justice concerns. They have helped to educate students, professional organizations and agencies about environmental justice issues, issues that can be particularly complex, fraught with social conflict and controversy, and, for all these reasons, not easily resolved.</p><p>What unfortunately also seems clear is that academic contributions, while valuable, have largely been ad hoc and uncoordinated. This is partly because the institutional support for academics to provide these services varies widely among institutions and fields of study. But, just as importantly, it is also because the relationship between EPA policymaking and academic research related to environmental justice issues has been uncertain at best, making it unclear how this research has been used by EPA. More often, the EPA's statements of policy, finalized rules and specific adjudications do not directly respond to the comments of academics or the larger environmental justice community.</p><p>In no manner, however, should the need for greater input from academics become an occasion for the diminishment of the voices that must be heard from the environmental justice communities themselves. Environmental justice can occur only with the direct participation of impacted communities. And no academic 'expert' can speak for those in the community. There is nonetheless a risk that greater involvement by academics may have just that perverse result. Often, Agency personnel prefer to speak with academics instead of engaging affected communities directly. Both to anticipate and minimize that possibility, EPA should consider training or internal guidance to help personnel understand the appropriate role of academics in addressing environmental justice.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77947' target='_blank'>Future Mechanisms to Enhance Stakeholder Involvement and Engagement to Address Environmental Justice</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>12 - 13</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>The National Environmental Justice Advisory Council's (NEJAC) report on mechanisms to enhance future stakeholder involvement and <br>engagement to achieve environmental justice for all communities.</td></tr></tbody>",

Such venues have the dual purpose of ensuring continued community and stakeholder input to EPA and other government agencies, and just as important, provide an opportunity for different groups to interact with each other. The latter outcome builds greater understanding of the complex issues involved and forms a basis for collaborations that address such issues. EPA and others can conduct these in the context of ongoing programmatic activities of EPA and in collaboration with other governmental and non-governmental organizations. The recent New Mexico Environmental Justice Listening Sessions, which resulted in a New Mexico Environmental Justice Executive Order is a prime example of such an effort. Also, EPA New England (Region 1) recently convened a 'Science of Environmental Justice' Workshop.</p><p>In the past, the NEJAC has serve a critical function by bringing together a wide range of persons, from impacted communities, EPA, state and local governments, academia, and business and industry, to dialogue about environmental justice. Semi-annual or annual NEJAC public meetings were often viewed as, and called, a 'NEJAC conference.' They also were expected to address a wide range of site-specific issues. However, the NEJAC, as a federal advisory committee, was never well suited to serve the functions either of convening broad groups to fully engage around multiple and varied environmental justice issues nor addressing site-specific issues. As more capacity and experience on environmental justice now exists among EPA, federal, state, tribal, and local government, community-based organizations, business and industry, academia, and civic organizations, EPA should explore the idea of supporting, in collaboration with other organizations, a biennial conference on environmental justice. The purpose of such a conference will be to provide a venue for providing information and dialogue regarding current and new initiatives, policy and program developments, new research, new collaborations, lessons learned, and best practices. It also can serve as an excellent venue to conduct training.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77947' target='_blank'>Future Mechanisms to Enhance Stakeholder Involvement and Engagement to Address Environmental Justice</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>14</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>The National Environmental Justice Advisory Council's (NEJAC) report on mechanisms to enhance future stakeholder involvement and <br>engagement to achieve environmental justice for all communities.</td></tr></tbody>",

EPA should also evaluate the examples of ''regulatory reinvention'' projects that have been considered successful by both the impacted community and the business and industry project participants. Three criteria are fundamental to appropriate business and industry incentives: (1) the reductions in impact must go beyond regulatory compliance to tangibly improve community health and quality of life; (2) the level of incentive must be proportional to the degree of improvement and the expectation that the largest contributors to the community burden will make the greatest efforts to reduce negative impacts; and (3) the rewards are developed in the course of collaborative dialogue among impacted community members, business and industry and the regulators.

The cleanup team (including the lead federal agency, EPA Regions, states, tribes, and local government) should do a better job of incorporating and addressing cultural differences in their current assessments. Such assessments need to account for cultural, ethnic, historical, and educational factors, as well as work/family ethics and local governing bodies, such as tribal councils and labor union leadership. This assessment also would help to determine local communities need in understanding government culture, policy, and procedures in order to more effectively participate in the cleanup and transfer process. Such an assessment would help focus the necessary and important next steps in cleanup, cultural sensitivity training, and governmental policy and culture training. Both the assessment and training should be incorporated into a formal community relations plan.<p>This assessment also should make a point to identify culture and regionally unique gathering spots. Each culture may have different gathering spots where broad numbers of the community could be reached. These gathering areas could be places, such as houses of worship, tribal ceremonial gathering sites, or some other area or culturally unique place. Knowing where people congregate will provide the government with an opportunity to enhance communications and the cross training of cultures. </p><p>Once the assessment identifies any cultural divides between the local community and federal government, a training plan needs to be developed to educate all parties about cultural differences that may exist among local groups (such as differences between tribal groups, and/or differences between different local ethnic groups, and workers) and local groups about governmental culture, policies, and procedures. Both the government and community need to be included in this education program, which should be reviewed by community leaders first to ensure that all relevant cultural differences have been identified. Two types of training should be conducted for trainers and participants. Training for trainers would allow for the frequent repetition of the cultural training to ensure that any new participants in the process receive the same training as former participants and that cultural sensitivity does not diminish with time or the inevitable departure and replacement of project team members. Repetitive training also helps to refresh the awareness of team members to ensure they do not lose sight of the local community stakeholders and what is important to them.</p></li><li>Improved Communication Methods: Once cultural awareness training is completed, effective communication methods need to be developed. Again, each local, ethnic, and/or tribal culture has its own unique style and method of communication. In communities where English is not the prevalent language, documents need to be translated into the common language and translators should be present at all Advisory Board and public meetings, such as at Kelly Air Force Base. For communication, 'one size does not fit all.' Just as work safety plans are required to be site specific, communications plans must also. The government might wrongly assume that there is no objection to a cleanup activity if few comments are received. Oral communications and the personal interaction and respect are important parts of communication, as are other oral means of communication, such as the radio. The communications plan should detail how the government will take cultural and regional gathering spots into consideration when communicating with the community for maximum effectiveness. This type of site-specific consideration is fundamental to form a proper communications plan.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77601' target='_blank'>Environmental Justice and Federal Facilities: Recommendations for Improving Stakeholder Relations Between Federal Facilities and Environmental Justice Communities</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>This report presents recommendations to the EPA and other agencies associated with the cleanup of federal facilities with the aim of improving relationships between facilities, communities, regulators and governmental bodies involved in the cleanup of contaminated federal facility sites.

Community residents reaffirm that advisory boards should complement, rather than duplicate or supplant, broader site level cleanup public involvement initiatives. Not all environmental justice community members have the time (especially DOE's Advisory Boards) or desire to commit to serving on a formal board, yet believe they should have a voice in the process. Facilities must ensure the availability of opportunities for residents who are not members of the board to participate fully in discussions and decision making regarding cleanup. </p><p>Environmental justice communities, as well as many federal agencies, support the need for communication vehicles outside of the advisory boards. A myriad of methods should be used to interact with and engage the public. Effective vehicles for two-way communication between the facility and regulator, tribes, and the environmental justice community include community workshops, trainings, and community-based organized activities. Environmental justice communities can work with the facility to identify the best ways to communicate with each other. There is no cookie-cutter approach that will work for all sites and communities, and particularly not for all tribes.</p><p>The Environmental Justice Public Participation Checklist for Government Agencies provides a framework for considering communication vehicles and strategies that can assist facilities in establishing a two-way interactive process. This checklist includes the following: </p><ul><li>Identify key individuals who can represent various stakeholder interests. Learn as much as possible about stakeholders and their concerns through personal consultation, phone, or written contacts. Ensure that information-gathering techniques include modifications for minority and low-income communities (for example, consider language and cultural barriers, technical background, literacy, access to respondents, privacy issues and preferred types of communications). </li><li>Solicit stakeholder involvement early in the policy-making process, beginning in the planning and development stages and continuing through implementation and oversight. </li><li>Develop co-sponsoring/co-planning relationships with community organizations and provide resources for their needs. </li><li>Establish a central point of contact within the federal agency to assist in information dissemination and problem resolutions, and to serve as a visible and accessible advocate of the public's right to know about issues that affect health or environment. </li><li>Regionalize materials to ensure cultural sensitivity and relevance. Make information understandable and readily accessible (for example, access for the handicapped and sight and hearing impaired). Unabridged documents should be placed in repositories. Executive summaries and fact sheets should be prepared in layman's language. Whenever practicable and appropriate, translate targeted documents for limited English speaking populations. </li><li>Schedule meetings and/or public hearings at times that are accessible and user-friendly for environmental justice stakeholders. Consider time frames that do not conflict with work schedules, rush hours, dinner hours and other community commitments that may decrease attendance. Consider locations and facilities that are local, convenient, and represent neutral turf. Ensure that the facility meets the Americans with Disabilities Act standards. Provide assistance for hearing-impaired individuals. Whenever practical and appropriate, provide translators for limited-English speaking communities. Advertise the meeting and its proposed agenda in a timely manner in the print and electronic media. Provide a phone number and/or address for communities to find out about pending meetings, issues, enter concerns, seek participation, or alter meeting agendas. </li><li>Consider other vehicles to increase participation of environmental justice stakeholders including: posters and exhibits; participation in civic and community activities; public database and bulletin boards; surveys; telephone hotlines; training and education programs; workshops; and materials.</li><li>After holding a public forum in a community, establish a procedure to follow up with concrete action to address the communities' concerns. (This will help to establish credibility for your Agency as having an active role in the federal government.) </li><li>Hold workshops, seminars, and other meetings to develop partnerships among agencies, workers, and community groups. (Ensure mechanisms are in place for implementing partnerships via cooperative agreements.) </li><li>Provide effective outreach, education, and communications. Findings should be shared with community members, with an emphasis on being sensitive and respectful to race, ethnicity, gender, language, and culture. </li><li>Assure active participation of affected communities in the decision-making process for outreach, education, training and community programs, including representation on advisory councils and review committees. </li><li>Provide 'open microphone' format during meetings to allow community members to ask questions and identify issues from the community.</li></ul><p>However, it is possible for an agency to check off every item in the checklist without really soliciting the participation of environmental justice communities, which can result in communities perceiving a lack of justice. Agencies should use the same type of 'worse case' analysis for community involvement that are used for physical remedies. For example, when installing a pump and treat systems, agencies calculate the maximum amount of liquid they can extract, not just the average or minimum. The same should be true for community relations. Agencies should aim to develop working relationships with their strongest critics in communities, not just their best friends or who they consider 'average' community members. </p><p>In general, community involvement processes should provide opportunities for the environmental justice community and general public to receive clear, comprehensive information about cleanup activities, and the mechanisms and structure to affect these decisions. Such efforts are an integral part of cleanup programs and should be required. Community involvement efforts should reach out to the broadest possible range of stakeholders and seek their involvement through a variety of effective and innovative methods appropriate to their specific community.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77601' target='_blank'>Environmental Justice and Federal Facilities: Recommendations for Improving Stakeholder Relations Between Federal Facilities and Environmental Justice Communities</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>15 -18</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>This report presents recommendations to the EPA and other agencies associated with the cleanup of federal facilities with the aim of improving relationships between facilities, communities, regulators and governmental bodies involved in the cleanup of contaminated federal facility sites.

Begin with an alternatives analysis. Deny a permit if there is a practicable alternative to siting the facility in or near an impacted community and use regulatory incentives to facilitate permitting at the alternative site (e.g., expedited permitting, emission trades, alternative compliance requirements such as emission caps and budgets, etc.). If a facility must be sited in a highly impacted community, strive to avoid adverse impacts; then minimize adverse impacts that cannot be avoided (e.g., through specialized control technology, alternative production processes, site-specific land management practices, buffer zones, alternative traffic routes, etc.); finally, provide compensatory mitigation (such as reducing emissions from other sources in the area) for the remaining risks. Similar approaches can be found in the Clean Water Act section 404 permit program, the Endangered Species incidental takings permit program, and transferable development rights used to protect historic buildings. </li><li>In addition to cumulative exposure, consider: <ol><li>health and ecological risk assessments; </li><li>the economic burden of medical costs and lost productivity; </li><li>access to health care; </li><li>psychological impacts; </li><li>the risk of chemical accidents; </li><li>emergency preparedness; </li><li>community right-to-know in permitting; and </li><li>an applicant's compliance history in issuing permits in low-income and minority communities. </li></ol></li><li>Recognize that a community's environmental concerns may be considerably broader than the media-specific technical criteria used by federal and state permit agencies. Indeed, community concerns encompass such quality-of-life issues as: <ol><li>noise; </li><li>dust; </li><li>constant truck traffic; </li><li>roadway congestion; </li><li>blocked roadway access due to truck parking violations; </li><li>debris falling from trash trucks; </li><li>safety issues raised by trucks speeding through residential areas; </li><li>rats; </li><li>odors; </li><li>house vibrations; </li><li>sleep deprivation due to all-night traffic; </li><li>deteriorated property values; and </li><li>general neighborhood decline.</li></ol><p>EPA should clarify that federally required permits need to consider such affronts, because states administering delegated permit programs have told adjacent communities that permit writers lack jurisdiction over such problems. </p></li><li>Consider the level of franchise (i.e., access to, and ability to influence, government) of different communities in permitting and establish more preventative approaches where necessary to protect the integrity of the permit process. (This recommendation stems from the fact that low-income and minority communities historically have lacked the resources necessary to monitor polluting facilities in their communities and, if violations are found, either to persuade government officials to take enforcement action or to bring their own citizen enforcement actions.) </li><li>Require federally mandated permits to respect local zoning ordinances which protect communities against increases in pollution; citizens allege that one such model ordinance in Chester, Pennsylvania was given no weight in the permit process. </li><li>Consider the discriminatory impact of historical land use patterns in deciding whether to use whatever discretionary authority EPA may have to remedy environmental injustices through the state and federal permit process.</li><li>Require an allocation mechanism that addresses future projects so that the first permit applicant does not absorb all of a neighborhood's potential for growth (e.g., traffic capacity or clean air increment).</li><li>Take cognizance of whether permit applicants propose to displace older, more polluting facilities. </li><li>Expedite the permit process for facilities that have been invited into communities and enjoy widespread community support since speed and predictability offer important market advantages to permit applicants.</li><li>Focus more attention on pollution prevention activities, both as a condition of permits and as a way to avoid toxic releases altogether.</li></ol></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77927' target='_blank'>Environmental Justice in the Permitting Process</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>24 - 25</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC) to provide advice and recommendations on the following question: <br>'In order to secure protection from environmental degradation for all citizens, what factors should be considered by a federal permitting authority, as well as state or local agencies with delegated permitting responsibilities, in the decision-making process prior to allowing a new pollution-generating facility to operate in a minority and/or low income community that may already have a number of such facilities?'

(A copy of the Resolution adopted by NEJAC can be found in the NEJAC Executive Summary Report on the EPA Web Site as Appendix B.)</li><li>(From the Council on Environmental Quality), convene community-level interagency meetings modeled on successful meetings in Los Angeles and New York City. The meetings would serve to apply principles of environmental justice at the community level, generate a mutually agreed upon agenda, and spotlight local environmental justice problems. Participants should include community leaders, government officials, and Congressional representatives. The meeting should endeavor to produce a series of commitments to the local community. Tr. I-29-37. (While the agenda at such a meeting probably would range well beyond permitting, the meeting could provide a forum to resolve permit issues, among other community concerns.) </li><li>Adopt binding public participation requirements which ensure permit writers will consult with affected communities ''early and often.'' Specifically:<ol><li>Contact potentially affected communities as soon as an agency is aware that a permit application may be filed or that emissions from a facility may increase, but in no event later than immediately upon receipt of the permit application or notice that emissions could increase. </li><li>Hold an initial hearing or informal meeting with the potentially affected communities immediately upon receipt of a permit application. </li><li>Accurately identify community leaders; do not rely on local government to represent low-income or minority communities. </li><li>Develop a plan for community involvement in conjunction with the community.</li><li>Require a community outreach plan modelled on those used with success in the brownfields grants program; follow up to ensure that the plan is implemented. </li><li>Use broadcast media and other effective forms of communication to advertise the public participation process. </li><li>Require permit notices in newspapers to be printed in legible print and to be placed in spots likely to attract the attention of potentially affected residents. </li><li></li><li>In public notices of proposed permits, describe what the discharge/emission means to the community in lay, rather than technical, terms. Otherwise, comment periods end before communities learn about potential impacts. </li><li>Utilize local government resources as well by bringing local government into the process as early as possible. </li><li>Make technical reports accessible to the community as soon as they are available, rather than holding them internally until commencement of a 30'day comment period. The 30-day comment period is often an inadequate time in which to obtain independent technical advice on the complicated issues involved in permitting.

In pre-meeting interviews, stakeholders identified a variety of obvious, as well as innovative, ways to accomplish this objective, including: <ol><li>bucket brigades in which citizens learn how to collect and send samples to EPA-approved labs (used as the basis for at least one successful enforcement action in Region IX), </li><li>requiring companies with continuous emission monitoring to have digital printouts on stacks reporting their emission limits, </li><li>Community Advisory Committees, </li><li>monitoring and enforcement by other governmental entities (e.g., tribes and local governments), </li><li>use of qualified consultants, </li><li>community-facility good neighbor agreements, and </li><li>daily posting of compliance data on the web. </li></ol></li><li>Assess, for the purposes of developing benchmarks, whether required public participation programs associated with permitting are working effectively because there is considerable testimony to the effect that such efforts are extremely problematic.

There, researchers used GIS mapping systems, demographic data, the Toxic Release Inventory database, other facility siting information, and a physical inventory conducted by community members to publish a report on cumulative exposure entitled ''Holding Our Breath.'' Noteworthy findings included the fact that 70% of area facilities were not reporting to environmental agencies and, hence, were not identified in agency databases. In addition, an industrial chrome plating facility had been permitted immediately adjacent to an elementary school. Such research can be an essential tool for community empowerment, enabling communities to identify appropriate permit terms and conditions or circumstances in which permitting should not go forward.

The Subcommittee cautioned that, in practice, state and local variances receive little scrutiny, reflect highly subjective standards, and are relatively easy to obtain. Federal recognition of these variances would preclude both federal and community enforcement suits, potentially increasing emissions in low-income and minority communities which disproportionately host polluting facilities. Instead, the Subcommittee recommended that EPA exercise case-by-case prosecutorial discretion to determine whether or not Clean Air Act violations due to alleged malfunction, start-up, shut down, or maintenance merit enforcement.

Specifically, communities could proactively undertake toxic reductions (e.g., replace diesel-fueled buses with natural gas-fueled vehicles, retrofit pollution controls on existing trucks and buses, replace oil-based solvents with waterbased products) and identify still further potential emission reductions. Accomplished emission reductions would provide room for new growth; targeted, desired reductions would identify potential offsets for new sources. Both types of reductions -- and the streamlined, expedited permitting EPA would offer new sources in these communities -- would make the communities more attractive to new development than communities where further growth would cause environmental justice problems. </li><li> Explore whether global facility permits, used in several states, provide an opportunity to reduce total emission loadings</li><li>Recognize that compliance alternatives are a huge potential loophole in permitting. Trading, in particular, allows a company to bypass public involvement and obviate community gains in permitting. EPA, therefore, should adhere to the recommendations of the Enforcement Subcommittee of NEJAC as outlined in their comments on the Economic Incentive Program document, a copy of which can be found in the NEJAC Executive Summary Report on the EPA Web Site as Appendix B. If trading is to be allowed, consider some or all of the following limitations on it: <ul><li>restrict its use to situations that directly and favorably impact conditions in environmental justice communities. </li><li>avoid using counties as a geographic area for emission trading purposes because California has counties (like San Bernadino) that are as big as Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts combined. Reducing pollution in the county as a whole may still impact environmental justice communities adversely or disproportionately. </li><li>avoid emission trading of lead emissions. </li><li>consider that less poisoning of a community is still poisoning. </li><li>prohibit streamlining or expediting the permit process in overly impacted communities because additional time may be needed to evaluate the additional complex issues presented in these communities.</li></ul></li><li>Create an environmental emission trading review board of representatives of environmental justice communities; federal, state, and local officials; and experts in health, engineering, and real estate. The board would rank and prioritize environmental justice projects, contract for professional services where necessary, use a pre-funded $50 million emission trading bank to address disparate impacts, and auction emission reduction credits.</li></ol></li></ol></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77927' target='_blank'>Environmental Justice in the Permitting Process</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>31 - 32</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC) to provide advice and recommendations on the following question: <br>'In order to secure protection from environmental degradation for all citizens, what factors should be considered by a federal permitting authority, as well as state or local agencies with delegated permitting responsibilities, in the decision-making process prior to allowing a new pollution-generating facility to operate in a minority and/or low income community that may already have a number of such facilities?'

Identify community leaders accurately; do not rely on local government to represent environmental justice communities, because many low-income and/or minority communities do not have visibility or political influence. However, consistent with the government-to-government relationship with tribal governments and the federal trust responsibility owed to them, in the case of Native American communities, initial outreach efforts should, in the first instance, be directed to the tribal governments as representatives of their communities and to their tribal members. Additional outreach to other potentially affected persons and nongovernmental organizations also may be needed to ensure optimal public participation.</li><li> Encourage and support ongoing consultation between tribes and the permitting agency throughout the permit process. . </li><li>Modify public participation requirements to account for the special problems attendant in reaching small, isolated rural communities on tribal lands. </li><li>Develop core water quality standards for permitting on tribal lands lacking such standards. Federal action is necessary because tribes which have adopted their own standards have found those standards attacked approved water quality standards, protect the quality of reservation waters from excessive degradation due to licensing or permitting activities by developing, in consultation and agreement with tribes, core water quality standards. </li><li>Include tribal lands in best management practice and regulatory requirements applicable to waste transfer stations.</li></ol></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77927' target='_blank'>Environmental Justice in the Permitting Process</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>32 - 33</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC) to provide advice and recommendations on the following question: <br>'In order to secure protection from environmental degradation for all citizens, what factors should be considered by a federal permitting authority, as well as state or local agencies with delegated permitting responsibilities, in the decision-making process prior to allowing a new pollution-generating facility to operate in a minority and/or low income community that may already have a number of such facilities?'

Support sustained and structured public dialogue on Brownfields and environmental justice on all levels. <br>The Subcommittee appreciates EPA's realization of the need for and its commitment to a systematic and sustained national dialogue on Brownfields and environmental justice. Such a commitment requires some structured mechanisms (such as community advisory boards) for communities to engage EPA, government and other stakeholders, around their concerns. In this case, NEJAC developed its Public Participation Model upon which the Public Dialogues were modeled. Other mechanisms--on national, regional, and local levels--must be created and supported. In addition to traditional areas of public participation (such as planning and the oversight of cleanup) the public should play a role in the review of research projects, and the development of grant proposals.</p><p>1-2. Develop efforts to empower stakeholders through information and education. Conduct the Brownfields program in ways which offer a real sense of hope.<br>Public Dialogue participants indicated that many residents of impacted communities do not participate due to despair, apathy, lack of time and resources, or because they have just given up. In addition to specific recommendations to ensure better access, ranging from holding meetings at convenient times and accessible places to use of non-traditional outreach methods, the Subcommittee also emphasizes the need for government to foster encouragement and a sense of hope that is based upon results. In addition to participation in the decision-making process, residents must also participate in any social, environmental, and economic benefits that results from decisions. The education process also must include ways to provide communities with enough tools and information so they understand they can influence the political process beyond existing mechanisms.</p><p>1-3.

Form the requisite partnerships both inside and outside of government to better understand and address urban revitalization/Brownfields issues of concern to youth.</p><p>3-2. Through the Brownfields initiative, integrate environmental activities and career development with targeted environmental justice and urban revitalization strategies.<br>A significant amount of resources and attention is devoted to engage young persons in the pursuit of careers related to the environmental. Environmental justice and urban revitalization create opportunities to make current educational programs more relevant by integrating study and action around issues related to 'the place where we live, work, and play.' Public education can be engaged in highly productive and compelling ways. EPA should partner with other agencies to support efforts by public schools, community colleges, public and private universities, and other educational institutions to integrate these issues. Environmental justice and urban revitalization also offer opportunities to change the serious inadequacy of cultural diversity in EPA and professions related to the environment. Moreover, they allow for integration across disciplinary lines to make for career paths more relevant to the needs of the 21st century.</p><p>3-3. Expand environmental education opportunities for urban youth through urbanenvironmental education centers.<br>Revitalization of Brownfields sites also present the opportunity to expand the education for inner-city youth. These sites could be converted to urban environmental educational activities that could serve as a mechanism through which youth could engage in environmental education activities. Since Brownfields sites are the result of past environmental practices, these centers could focus on activities that promote the long-term sustainability of cities, and in turn, of the sites themselves. Experiential education programs take youth from urban areas to camps outside the city to train them on team building activities. The environmental education centers could assume the function of these experiential programs directly in the neighborhoods in which the youth live. Such a change also allows for a curriculum that focuses on issues (such as environmental justice) that these youths face on a daily basis. These centers also increase the possibility that any solutions adopted for Brownfields revitalization today will be long-term or permanent. By incorporating youth ideas and initiatives now, we reduce the possibility that these youths, when they become adults will fundamentally alter initiatives and solutions we adopt now.</p><p>3-4. Provide support for youth-led projects.<br>One proposed method to involve youth is through the YouthBuild program. Because YouthBuild is a national organization with sites in most major cities, it provides an opportunity to solicit ideas from, and the involvement of a core group of youth nationwide. Another noteworthy example is Commencement 2000, an environmental education urban forestry project in Oakland, California initiated by the U.S. Forest Service.</p><p>3-5.

Examine land use patterns of an entire metropolitan area or region surrounding Brownfields sites.<br>Brownfields do not exist in a vacuum. Activities formerly in these areas often have not simply ceased to exist, but moved to other areas. New development must choose between locating in Brownfields communities and Greenfields areas. If the perception exists that Greenfields are the place to invest due to various amenities there and the disamenities in urban areas, it will be difficult to attract development regardless of what is done to enhance a Brownfields area. If government is in fact subsidizing Greenfields development, it may become impossible to attract outside capital.</p><p>7-2. Identify natural advantages of Brownfields areas.<br>Industry originally was built in urban centers and Brownfields areas because of natural advantages such as access to water, transportation, or natural features. Additional infrastructure such as sewerage, universities, and transportation links were built around these industrial centers and often remain. In addition, these areas often are less susceptible to natural disasters. These natural advantages must be identified, chronicled and disseminated to improve perceptions of these areas.</p><p>If the real costs of new roads, new sewage systems, increased automobile traffic, and other financial burdens of Greenfields development were incorporated into developer costs or not subsidized by the government, Brownfields areas would be more competitive. The playing field between Brownfields sites and Greenfields sites actually may be level when natural advantages of the urban core are taken into account. The playing field may actually be fair if Greenfields development is not subsidized.</p><p>7-3. Encourage and support the involvement of non-traditional stakeholders (such as community-based organizations) in government processes, such as zoning issues.<br>Government officials should be accountable for not only providing ''opportunities'' for public input but, in making a good faith effort to succeed in securing public input, it is not enough to simply hold a meeting or provide opportunities for access. Government officials must make an effort to achieve meaningful public participation through long-term consistent interaction with community-based organizations and institutions. Educating the public about basic decision-making processes that determine development and zoning patterns will result in stronger democratic processes, greater public participation, and better decision making for the public as a whole.</p><p>7-4. Encourage investment in degraded urban environments by supporting and integrating activities to improve public safety access to health care, schools, and other social factors that may limit investment even after cleanup.<br>This can take the form of linking federal grants from other agencies to Brownfields grants in communities. Community-based groups working on broader social justice problems can be educated and supported on environmental problems and solutions through urban redevelopment. Federal programs such as AmeriCorps, already focus on environment and public safety as separate areas. How can they be joined? Programs such as the Empowerment and Enterprise zones can bring far more resources to bear on the same communities and problems than can the Brownfields initiatives on their own.</p><p>7-5. Explore the linkages between U.S. government international trade policies, disinvestment in urban areas, and reinvestment in Greenfields sites.<br>U.S. trade policies and commitment to free trade have reduced barriers to existing U.S. companies moving to other countries in search of cheap labor. In theory, the dropping of these barriers and the creation of new markets for U.S. products purchased by newly hired workers will result in a new gain in hobs and economic activity in our country. It is likely the plants that close are disproportionately older plants located in Brownfields areas while the new U.S. plants built to serve new markets are located in Greenfields areas. Although U.S. trade policy is designed to bring about a net benefit for the country as a whole, it will be necessary to assess where these benefits and losses occur and steps be taken to level the playing field.</p><p>7-6. Urge cities, states, tribal and territorial governments to review their planning and land use review and permitting processes to address environmental justice issues, such as environmental health, cumulative risk, and incompatible mixed land uses; offer assistance to local governments for incorporating public participation and accountability in formulating policies and plans and in local decision-making.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77933' target='_blank'>Environmental Justice, Urban Revitalization, and Brownfields: The Search for Authentic Signs of Hope</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>42 - 42</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>This document contains a copy of the final report, 'Environmental Justice, Urban Revitalization, and Brownfields: The Search for Authentic Signs of Hope.'

Each has emphasized their commitment to fulfilling the mandates of Executive Order 12898 as well as their overall support for reforming Agency practices as necessary to promote environmental justice concerns. But neither has issued any formal analysis of the extent to which the EPA might affirmatively use its permitting authority to address environmental justice. In response to an earlier draft of this memorandum, however, the EPA provided the NEJAC enforcement subcommittee with a chart listing of statutory provisions (and corresponding regulations) that might provide the Agency with as of yet unexercised authority to address environmental justice concerns, including within the permitting process. A memorandum accompanying that chart warns that 'the inclusion of a statutory or regulatory provision in the charts is not intended to suggest that any conclusion has been reached as to the practicality or effectiveness of using such authorities for environmental justice purposes.' A copy of that memorandum and attached chart is appended to this memorandum. </p><p>Unfortunately, the issue has instead arisen before the Agency and been formally addressed by it only on a case by case basis and in a defensive posture. A Regional EPA Office or a State environmental agency with permitting authority pursuant to a federal environmental law has initially refused to account for environmental justice factors in exercising its permitting authority. Disappointed environmental justice advocates have challenged those negative determinations before the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board. And, in all four cases, the Environmental Appeals Board has rejected the appeals and affirmed the permitting authority's negative rulings.</p><p>The disadvantages of the Agency's considering the issue only in this posture are considerable. First, case-by-case adjudication does not readily lend itself to the kind of broad, systemic Agency reforms required for the promotion of environmental justice. In a more adversarial setting, the natural impulse for most Agency decision makers is to deny the existence of a legal obligation -- in this context, the obligation to consider environmental justice in a permitting decision. There is also a substantial risk that in making that argument, agency personnel will take the further step of denying authority. Although 'authority' and 'legal obligation' are legally distinct concepts, one can always buttress one's denial of the latter by extending it to a denial of the former. And, conversely, any admission of 'authority' makes it harder to deny that such authority may, in some circumstances, become a 'legal obligation' based, for example on a party's claim of abuse of discretion. There is reason to expect, therefore, that the tendency of case by case adjudication will be to make systemic reform promoting environmental justice more difficult. Overcoming this tendency will require top-down directives that the Agency wants to exercise its discretionary authority to promote environmental justice, extending beyond what the Agency is legally obligated to do. </p><p>A closer look at each of the four Environmental Appeals Board decisions underscores these limits of case-by-case adjudication. It also hints at how the Agency might, through the exercise of permitting authority, exploit currently untapped avenues for furthering the environmental justice goals of Executive Order 12898.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77609' target='_blank'>Draft Memorandum on Integrating Environmental Justice into EPA Permitting Authority</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>3 - 4</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>This document is a memorandum that seeks to address the extent to which the EPA possesses permitting authority that it is not yet effectively exercising on behalf of environmental justice concerns.</td></tr></tbody>",

The Refuse Act's restrictions on water pollution, NEPA's strict procedural requirements, the Clean Air Act's PSD program, and, more recently, Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, are all very much products of such innovative and expansive interpretations of existing statutory language.</p><p>This issue now before the Agency is whether existing statutory and regulatory language can similarly be resurrected on behalf of environmental justice. Not withstanding there generally rigid outlook, the Appeals Board opinions discussed above set forth two possibilities: the omnibus clause contained in Section 3005(c)(3) of RCRA, discussed in CWM of Indiana, and the omnibus clause contained in the Safe Drinking Water Act regulation, 40 C.F.R. 144.52(a)(9), discussed in the Envotech. In addition, the draft EPA memorandum and chart prepared by the Agency, and provided to this Subcommittee in response to an initial draft of the memorandum, lists several other statutory provisions that authorize the Agency to address more fully environmental justice concerns. A copy of that memorandum and chart is appended to this memorandum.</p><p>What this portion of the memorandum seeks to accomplish is to examine the statutory language of each of the several environmental protection laws, one statute at a time, in an effort to identify clauses in addition to RCRA Section 3005(c)(3) and the SDWA regulation 40 C.F.R. 144.52(a)(9), that might similarly support expansive understandings of the EPA's authority to promote environmental justice through permit conditions and denials. This review does not purport to by exhaustive of all possibilities. The hope is instead that this memorandum may serve as a catalyst to prompt others, especially those far more familiar with the statutory and regulatory intricacies of the various programs, to find other examples as well.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Full Report</th><td><a href='/node/77609' target='_blank'>Draft Memorandum on Integrating Environmental Justice into EPA Permitting Authority</a></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Page Reference</th><td>12</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Report Description</th><td>This document is a memorandum that seeks to address the extent to which the EPA possesses permitting authority that it is not yet effectively exercising on behalf of environmental justice concerns.</td></tr></tbody>"
